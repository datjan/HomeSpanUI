# HomeKit Pairing

There are two ways to pair HomeSpanUI to HomeKit.

## use QR-Code
After deploying HomeSpanUI to an ESP32 you can access the webinterface. There you only have to scan the shown qr-code to connect to HomeKit.

## use Home App
At least you can pair HomeSpanUI with your HomeKit with the help of the Apple "Home" App.

You have to use the “I Don’t Have a Code or Cannot Scan" or "Weitere Optionen..." function during adding process.
